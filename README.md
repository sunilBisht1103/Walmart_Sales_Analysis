# ðŸ›’ Walmart Sales Analytics Project(SQL + Python) 

![Project Pipeline](https://github.com/sunilBisht1103/Walmart_Sales_Analysis/blob/e98361693f8e43f4de0916f5421c90e1a3f309b6/walmart_image.png)



This project delivers advanced analytics on Walmart's transactional sales data using **SQL** and **Python**. It extends beyond basic analysis by incorporating advanced SQL techniques, Python, time-series analysis, anomaly detection, profitability optimization, and customer segmentation.

---

## Project Highlights

- **Advanced SQL Queries:**  
  Rolling averages, ranking, anomaly detection, price elasticity, and more.
  
- **ETL Pipeline (Python):**  
  Automated extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of raw transactional data into a relational database.

##Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sunilBisht1103/Walmart_Sales_Analysis.git
cd walmart_advanced_analysis

```
2. **Set Up Kaggle API
   - **API Setup**: Obtain your Kaggle API token from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) by navigating to your profile settings and downloading the JSON file.
   - **Configure Kaggle**: 
      - Place the downloaded `kaggle.json` file in your local `.kaggle` folder.
      - Use the command `kaggle datasets download -d <dataset-path>` to pull datasets directly into your project.
3. Download Walmart Sales Data
   - **Data Source**: Use the Kaggle API to download the Walmart sales datasets from Kaggle.
   - **Dataset Link**: [Walmart Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/najir0123/walmart-10k-sales-datasets)
   - **Storage**: Save the data in the `data/` folder for easy reference and access.

4.Install Python Dependencies:
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
  **Loading Data**: Read the data into a Pandas DataFrame for initial analysis and transformations.
  
5. Explore the Data
   - **Goal**: Conduct an initial data exploration to understand data distribution, check column names, types, and identify potential issues.
   - **Analysis**: Use functions like `.describe()`, and `.head()` to get a quick overview of the data structure and statistics.
   - 
6. Data Cleaning
   - **Remove Duplicates**: Identify and remove duplicate entries to avoid skewed results.
   - **Handle Missing Values**: Drop rows or columns with missing values if they are insignificant; fill values where essential.
   - **Fix Data Types**: Ensure all columns have consistent data types (e.g., dates as `datetime`, prices as `float`).
   - **Currency Formatting**: Use `.replace()` to handle and format currency values for analysis.
   
7. Load Data into MySQL
   - **Set Up Connections**: Connect to MySQL using `sqlalchemy` and load the cleaned data into database.
   - **Table Creation**: Set up tables in MySQL using Python SQLAlchemy to automate table creation and data insertion.
   - **Verification**: Run initial SQL queries to confirm that the data has been loaded accurately.
   - 
8. SQL Analysis: Complex Queries and Business Problem Solving
   - **Business Problem-Solving**: Write and execute complex SQL queries to answer critical business questions, such as:
     - Revenue trends across branches and categories.
     - Identifying best-selling product categories.
     - Sales performance by time.
     - Analyzing peak sales periods and customer buying patterns.
     - Profit margin analysis by branch and category.
   - **Documentation**: Keep clear notes of each query's objective, approach, and results.

## Results and Insights

This section will include your analysis findings:

**Sales Insights**

-Revenue & Profit Rank of Branches
```sql
WITH branch_summary AS (
  SELECT 
    branch,
    city,
    SUM(total) AS total_sales,
    SUM(profit_margin) AS total_profit
  FROM walmart
  GROUP BY branch, city
)
SELECT *,
  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY total_sales DESC) AS sales_rank,
  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY total_profit DESC) AS profit_rank
FROM branch_summary;
```
Insight: Quickly identify the best & worst performing branches in both sales & profitability.

-Category Contribution % (to Total Sales & Profit)
```sql
WITH category_summary AS (
  SELECT 
    category,
    SUM(total) AS total_sales,
    SUM(profit_margin) AS total_profit
  FROM walmart
  GROUP BY category
),
totals AS (
  SELECT 
    SUM(total) AS overall_sales,
    SUM(profit_margin) AS overall_profit
  FROM walmart_sales
)
SELECT 
  c.category,
  c.total_sales,
  ROUND((c.total_sales / t.overall_sales) * 100, 2) AS sales_percentage,
  c.total_profit,
  ROUND((c.total_profit / t.overall_profit) * 100, 2) AS profit_percentage
FROM category_summary c, totals t
ORDER BY sales_percentage DESC;
```
Insight: Helps with product strategy & inventory planning â€” focus on high-contribution categories.

**Pricing**

-Product Pricing Optimization (Price Sensitivity Check)
```sql
SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN unit_price < 50 THEN 'Low Price'
    WHEN unit_price BETWEEN 50 AND 100 THEN 'Mid Price'
    ELSE 'High Price'
  END AS price_band,
  SUM(quantity) AS total_units_sold,
  SUM(total) AS total_revenue,
  ROUND(AVG(rating), 2) AS avg_rating
FROM walmart_sales
GROUP BY price_band
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```
Insight: Reveals how pricing strategy impacts units sold, revenue, and customer satisfaction.

**Customer Behavior**

-Revenue Percentiles (Identifying VIP Transactions)
```sql
WITH percentiles AS (
  SELECT 
    invoice_id,
    total,
    NTILE(10) OVER (ORDER BY total DESC) AS revenue_decile
  FROM walmart
)
SELECT *
FROM percentiles
WHERE revenue_decile = 1;
```
Insight: Focus on top 10% of high-spend customers for targeted marketing (loyalty programs, premium services).

-Time-of-Day Sales Impact (Rolling Average by Hour)
```sql
WITH hourly_sales AS (
  SELECT 
    HOUR(TIME(time)) AS hour,
    SUM(total) AS total_sales
  FROM walmart
  GROUP BY hour
),
rolling_avg AS (
  SELECT 
    hour,
    total_sales,
    ROUND(AVG(total_sales) OVER (ORDER BY hour ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING), 2) AS moving_avg_sales
  FROM hourly_sales
)
SELECT *
FROM rolling_avg
ORDER BY hour;
```
Insight: Understand sustained peak hours instead of isolated spikes for better staffing & promotion planning.

## Future Enhancements

Possible extensions to this project:
- Integration with a dashboard tool (e.g., Power BI or Tableau) for interactive visualization.
- Additional data sources to enhance analysis depth.
- Automation of the data pipeline for real-time data ingestion and analysis.
